### A End-to-End Deployment of a Machine Learning Algorithm into a Live Production Environment

In this tutorial, we explore how to deploy a machine learning algorithm into a live production environment so that it could be “consumed” in a platform-agnostic way.  We'll start by using Jupyter Notebooks to develop a machine learning algorithm and progress to make it publicly available as a web application using Voila, GitHub and mybinder.

Kindly refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/hakngrow/drug_classification/blob/main/end-to-end_deployment_of_ml_algorithm_into_live.ipynb) for the entire tutorial.
